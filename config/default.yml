# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
# Instead, copy default.yml to local.yml first and make your config changes in local.yml (or only include the changed
# options). Keep in mind that the YAML format does not like tabs as indentation, you have to use spaces.
#
# Every setting that accepts an id needs to be enclosed with double quotes (").
# The reason is that the ids are too big for Node to handle properly as a number.
# Saving it as a string explicitly works around this issue.
#
# If you don't know any of the Discord ids (like roles or channels), the bot includes a !exportids command which
# by default only the owner can execute. A text file with all the ids will be DM'd to you.

# The permissions are set up in a hierarchical way. If a person is a member of more than 1 group,
# the first matched command in either blacklist or whitelist in a group (top-down) from the list below gets priority.
# This means that if in groupA commandA is listed, and user is part of groupA and wants to execute commandB, it will
# fall back to the next first group (that is not groupA) that the user is also part of, that has commandB either
# whitelisted or blacklisted explicitly. If none has been found, it will fall back to the default group.
#
# Please note that if both blacklist and whitelist are matched, blacklist will take precedence.
#
# To add a new group, just add a new key and fill in the properties.
# Be sure to *not* delete default, as this is the fallback group in case nothing is matched.
# The asterisk can be used as a wildcard.
#
# It's good practice to copy this to your own local config and change it to your own likings, because
# when you define the root permissions property, you will override all of the roles defined below.
